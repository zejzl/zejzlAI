Fix JSON parsing for stringified arrays in all agents

Root cause: AI responses sometimes return JSON with stringified array values like item1 item2 instead of proper arrays.

Solution: Added inline parsing logic to detect and parse stringified JSON arrays before using them.

Impact: All agents now handle both proper JSON arrays AND stringified arrays reliably.

Testing: Validated with test_json_parsing_fix.py - requirements properly returned as list type.
