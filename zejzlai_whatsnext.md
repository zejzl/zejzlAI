     - User interface (build a dashboard)
     - Integrations (connect to business tools)
     - Advanced AI (research and new capabilities)
     - Community (open source and ecosystem)

     ZEJZL.NET is now a powerful, enterprise-ready AI platform - let's decide the next
     chapter! 🚀✨

     - Enables automated code review workflows
     - Repository monitoring and issue management
     - CI/CD pipeline integration
     - Pull request analysis and suggestions

     This would transform ZEJZL.NET from a research framework into a
     production-ready development assistant!

     🔮 Long-term Vision

     After completing these integrations, Phase 5 focuses on:
     - Enterprise Security & Compliance (encryption, RBAC, audit logging)
     - Scalability & Performance (Kubernetes, advanced caching, monitoring)
     - Advanced AI Capabilities (multi-modal, custom models, marketplace)

     Which area would you like to tackle next? The external integrations
     would provide immediate practical value, while the advanced Notion
     features would enhance the existing knowledge management capabilities. 🚀
