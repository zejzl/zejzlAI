- **Value:** "To enhance the analysis, incorporate specific citations from recent studies (e.g., referencing papers from NeurIPS or ICML on multi-agent reinforcement learning) to substantiate the 30-50% efficiency gains and 15-25% accuracy improvements, thereby increasing credibility and allowing readers to verify claims. Optimize the structure by adding a subsection on mitigation strategies for communication overhead, such as decentralized protocols or gossip-based algorithms, to balance the discussion of advantages with actionable optimizations for scalability. Finally, expand implications with a forward-looking note on hybrid human-AI multi-agent systems to highlight untapped potential in adaptive learning environments."
